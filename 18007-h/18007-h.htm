<div class="poem">
<p class="title"><a id="JONGLEURS"></a>JONGLEURS.</p>

<p class="stanza">
What is the stir in the street?<br />
Hurry of feet!<br />
And after,<br />
A sound as of pipes and of tabers!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Men of the conflicts and labors,<br />
Struggling and shifting and shoving,<br />
Pushing and pounding your neighbors,<br />
Fighting for leeway for laughter,<br />
Toiling for leisure for loving!<br />
Hark, through the window and up to the rafter,<br />
Madder and merrier,<br />
Deeper and verier,<br />
Sweeter, contrarier,<br />
Dafter and dafter,<br />
A song arises,--<br />
A thrill, an intrusion,<br />
A reel, an illusion,<br />
A rapture, a crisis<br />
Of bells in the air!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Ay, up from your work and look out of the window!<br />
"Who are the newcomers, Arab or Hindoo?<br />
Persians, or Japs, or the children of Isis?"<br />
--Guesses, surmises--<br />
Forth with you, fare<br />
Down in the street to draw nearer and stare!<br />
Come from your palaces, come from your hovels!<br />
Lay down your ledgers, your picks and your shovels,<br />
Your trowels and bricks,<br />
<a id="page002"></a>
Hammers and nails,<br />
Scythes and flails,<br />
Bargains and sales,<br />
And the trader's tricks,<br />
Deals, overreachings,<br />
Worries and griefs,<br />
Teachings and preachings,<br />
Boluses, briefs,<br />
Writs and attachments,<br />
Quarterings, hatchments,<br />
Clans and cognomens,<br />
Comments and scholia,<br />
(World's melancholia)--<br />
Cast them aside, and good riddance to rubbish!<br />
Here at the street-corner, hearken, a strain,<br />
Rough and off-hand and a bit rub-a-dub-ish,<br />
Gives us a taste of the life we'd attain.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Who are they, what are they, whence have they come to us?<br />
Where will they go.when their singing is done?<br />
What is the garb they wear, tattered and sumptuous,<br />
Faded with days and superb in the sun?<br />
What are they singing of?<br />
Hush!<br />
... There's a ringing of<br />
Delicate chimes;<br />
And the blush<br />
Of a veiled bride morning<br />
Beats in the rhymes.<br />
Listen!<br />
Out of the merriment,<br />
Clear as the glisten<br />
Of dew on the brier,<br />
A silver warning!<br />
<a id="page003"></a>
Sudden, a dare--<br />
Lyric experiment--<br />
Up like a lark in the air,<br />
Higher and higher and higher,<br />
The song shoots out of our blunder<br />
Of thought to the blue sky of wonder,<br />
And broken strains only fall down<br />
Like pearls on the roofs of the town.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Somebody says they have come from the moon,<br />
Seen with their eyes Eldorado,<br />
Sat in the Bo-tree's shadow,<br />
Wandered at noon<br />
In the valleys of Van,<br />
Tented in Lebanon, tarried in Ophir,<br />
Last year in Tartary piped for the Khan.<br />
Now it's the song of a lover;<br />
Now it's the lilt of a loafer,--<br />
Under the trees in a midsummer noon,<br />
Dreaming the haze into isles to discover,<br />
Beating the silences into a croon;<br />
Soon<br />
Up from the marshes a fall of the plover!<br />
Out from the cover<br />
A flurry of quail!<br />
Down from the height where the slow hawks hover,<br />
The thin far ghost of a hail!<br />
And near, and near,<br />
Throbbing and tingling,--<br />
With a human cheer<br />
In the earth-song mingling,--<br />
Mirth and carousal,<br />
Wooing, espousal,<br />
Clinking of glasses<br />
And laughter of lasses--<br />
<a id="page004"></a>
And the wind in the garden stoops down as it passes<br />
To play with the hair<br />
Of the loveliest there,<br />
And the wander-lust catches the will in its snare;<br />
Hill-wind and spray-lure,<br />
Call of the heath;<br />
Dare in the teeth<br />
Of the balk and the failure;<br />
The clasp and the linger<br />
Of loosening finger,<br />
Loth to dissever;<br />
Thrill of the comrade heart to its fellow<br />
Through droughts that sicken and blasts that bellow<br />
From purple furrow to harvest yellow,<br />
Now and forever.<br />
How our feet itch to keep time to their measure!<br />
How our hearts lift to the lilt of their song!<br />
Let the world go, for a day's royal pleasure!<br />
Not every summer such waifs come along.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Now they are off to the inn;<br />
Hear the clean ring of their laughter!<br />
Cool as a hill-brook after<br />
The beat of the noon sets in!<br />
Gentlemen even in jollity--<br />
Certainly people of quality!--<br />
Waifs and estrays no less,<br />
Roofless and penniless,<br />
They are the wayside strummers<br />
Whose lips are man's renown,<br />
Those wayward brats of Summer's<br />
Who stroll from town to town;<br />
Spendthrift of life, they ravish<br />
The days of an endless store,<br />
<a id="page005"></a>
And ever the more they lavish<br />
The heap of the hoard is more.<br />
For joy and love and vision<br />
Are alive and breed and stay<br />
When dust shall hold in derision<br />
The misers of a day.<br />
</p>
</div>


<div class="poem">
<p class="title"><a id="EARTHS_LYRIC"></a>EARTH'S LYRIC.</p>

<p class="stanza">
April. You hearken, my fellow,<br />
Old slumberer down in my heart?<br />
There's a whooping of ice in the rivers;<br />
The sap feels a start.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
The snow-melted torrents are brawling;<br />
The hills, orange-misted and blue,<br />
Are touched with the voice of the rainbird<br />
Unsullied and new.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
The houses of frost are deserted,<br />
Their slumber is broken and done,<br />
And empty and pale are the portals<br />
Awaiting the sun.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
The bands of Arcturus are slackened;<br />
Orion goes forth from his place<br />
On the slopes of the night, leading homeward<br />
His hound from the chase.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
The Pleiades weary and follow<br />
The dance of the ghostly dawn;<br />
The revel of silence is over;<br />
Earth's lyric comes on.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<a id="page006"></a>
A golden flute in the cedars,<br />
A silver pipe in the swales,<br />
And the slow large life of the forest<br />
Wells bade and prevails.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
A breath of the woodland spirit<br />
Has blown out the bubble of spring<br />
To this tenuous hyaline glory<br />
One touch sets a-wing.<br />
</p>
</div>


<div class="poem">
<p class="title"><a id="WOOD-GOD"></a>THE WOOD-GOD.</p>

<p class="stanza">
Brother, lost brother!<br />
Thou of mine ancient kin!<br />
Thou of the swift will that no ponderings smother!<br />
The dumb life in me fumbles out to the shade<br />
Thou lurkest in.<br />
In vain--evasive ever through the glade<br />
Departing footsteps fail;<br />
And only where the grasses have been pressed,<br />
Or by snapped twigs I follow a fruitless trail.<br />
So--give o'er the quest!<br />
Sprawl on the roots and moss!<br />
Let the lithe garter squirm across my throat!<br />
Let the slow clouds and leaves above me float<br />
Into mine eyeballs and across,--<br />
Nor think them further! Lo, the marvel! now,<br />
Thou whom my soul desireth, even thou<br />
Sprawl'st by my side, who fled'st at my pursuit.<br />
I hear thy fluting; at my shoulder there<br />
I see the sharp ears through the tangled hair,<br />
And birds and bunnies at thy music mute.<br />
</p>
</div>


<div class="poem">
<a id="page007"></a>
<p class="title"><a id="FAUNS_SONG"></a>A FAUN'S SONG.</p>

<p class="stanza">
Cool! cool! cool!<br />
Cool and sweet<br />
The feel of the moss at my feet!<br />
And sweet and cool<br />
The touch of the wind, of the wind!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Cool wind out of the blue,<br />
At the touch of you<br />
A little wave crinkles and flows<br />
All over me down to my toes.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
"Coo-loo! Coo-loo!"<br />
Hear the doves in the tree-tops croon.<br />
"Coo-loo! Coo-loo!"<br />
Love comes soon.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
"June! June!"<br />
The veery sings,<br />
Sings and sings,<br />
"June! June!"--<br />
A pretty tune!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Wind with your weight of perfume,<br />
Bring me the bluebells' bloom!<br />
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="title"><a id="QUINCE_TO_LILAC"></a>QUINCE TO LILAC:
<span class="sc">To G. H.</span></p>

<p class="stanza">
Dear <i>Lilac</i>, how enchanting<br />
To hear of you this way!<br />
The Man who comes a-mouching<br />
To visit me each day<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Says you too have a lover<br />
Far lovelier than I.<br />
<a id="page008"></a>
And from his rapt description,<br />
She loves you gloriously.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
The Man prowls out each morning<br />
To see if spring's begun.<br />
What infinite amusement<br />
These creatures offer one!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
He asks me such conundrums<br />
As no one ever heard:<br />
The name of April's father,<br />
The trail of every bird,<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
What keeps me warm in winter,<br />
Who wakes me up in time,<br />
And why procrastination<br />
Is such a fearful crime.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
And yet, who knows? He may be<br />
Our equal ages hence--<br />
With such pathetic glimmers<br />
Of weird intelligence!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
But this your blessed alien,<br />
Why strays she roving here?<br />
Was Orpheus not her brother,<br />
Persephone her peer?<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Was she not once a dryad<br />
Whom Syrinx lulled to sleep<br />
Beside the Dorian water,<br />
And still her eyelids keep<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
The glad unperished secret<br />
From centuries of joy,<br />
And memories of the morning<br />
When Helen sailed for Troy?<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<a id="page009"></a>
Is her name Gertrude, Kitty,<br />
Hypatia, or what?<br />
I seem to half remember,<br />
And yet have quite forgot.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
That soft Hellenic laughter!<br />
I marvel you don't make<br />
An effort to be early<br />
In budding for her sake.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Just fancy hearing daily<br />
That velvet voice of hers!<br />
How do you quell the riot<br />
Of sap her coming stirs?<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Perhaps she puts her face up,<br />
(Dear Charity she is!)<br />
For messages of summer<br />
And better worlds than this.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
You cannot blush, poor Lilac;<br />
It is not in your race.<br />
I simply should go crimson,<br />
If I were in your place.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Do tell her all your secrets!<br />
The Man declares she knows<br />
Better than any mortal<br />
The wonder-trick of prose.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<i>Our</i> prose, I mean,--how beauty<br />
Appears to you and me;<br />
The truth that seems so simple,<br />
Which they call poetry.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
They put it down in writing<br />
And label it with tags,<br />
<a id="page010"></a>
The funny conscious people<br />
Who mask in colored rags!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
They have a thing called <i>science</i>,<br />
With phrases strange and pat.<br />
My dear, can you imagine<br />
Intelligence like that?<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
And when they first discover<br />
That yellows are not greens,<br />
They pucker up their foreheads<br />
And ponder what it means.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
And then those cave-like places,<br />
Churches and Capitols,<br />
Where they all come together<br />
Like troops of talking dolls,<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
To govern, as they term it,<br />
(It's really very odd!)<br />
And have what they call worship<br />
Of something they call God.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
But Kitty, or whatever<br />
May be her tender name,<br />
Is more like us. She guesses<br />
What sets the year aflame.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
She knows beyond her senses;<br />
Do tell her all you can!<br />
The funny people need it,--<br />
At least, so says The Man.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Good-by, dear. I must idle.<br />
Sweet suns and happy rains!<br />
How nice to have these humans<br />
With their inventive brains,--<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<a id="page011"></a>
Their little scraps of paper!<br />
They certainly evince<br />
Remarkable discernment.<br />
Your ever loving <i>Quince</i>.<br />

<div class="poem">
<p class="title"><a id="EASTER_MARKET"></a>AN EASTER MARKET.</p>

<p class="stanza">
Today, through your Easter market<br />
In the lazy Southern sun,<br />
I strolled with hands in pockets<br />
Past the flower-stalls one by one.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Indolent, dreamy, ready<br />
For anything to amuse,<br />
Shyfoot out for a ramble<br />
In his oldest hat and shoes.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Roses creamy and yellow,<br />
Azaleas crimson and white,<br />
And the flaky fresh carnations<br />
My Orient of delight,--<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Masses and banks of blossom<br />
That dazzle and summon the eye,<br />
Till the buyers are half bewildered<br />
To know what they want. Not I.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Who would not rather be artist<br />
And slip through the crowd unseen<br />
To gather it all in a picture<br />
And guess what the faces mean?<br />

As call at the dead of night,<br />
What sets your pulses a-quiver,<br />
What sets your fancy alight?<br />

<p class="stanza">
Sure of it! Mayflowers, mayflowers,<br />
Scent of the North in spring!<br />
Out in the vernal distance,<br />
Heart of me, whither a-wing?<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
"Give me some!" Clutch the first handful,<br />
Hungering rover of earth!<br />
How I devour and kiss them,<br />
Beauties that brought me to birth,<br />

Away in the great north country,<br />
The land of the lonely sun,<br />
Where God has few for his fellows,<br />

Once more to the frost-bound valley<br />
Comes April with rain in her jar;<br />
I can hear the vesper sparrow<br />
Under the silver star.<br />

<p class="stanza">
And many and dear and gracious<br />
Are the dreams that walk at my side<br />
From the land of the lingering shadows,<br />
As out of the throng I stride.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Oh, well for you, mere onlooker,<br />
Who drift through the world's great mart!<br />
But we of the human sorrow<br />
Have a joy beyond your art.<br />

<p class="stanza">
The bobolinks rallied them up from the dell,<br />

Word of a little one born in the West,--<br />
How like a sea-bird it comes from the sea,<br />
Out of the league-weary waters' unrest<br />
Blown with white wings, for a token, to me!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Blown with a skriel and a flurry of plumes<br />
(Sea-spray and flight-rapture whirled in a gleam!)<br />
Here for a sign of the comrade that looms<br />
Large in the mist of my love as I dream.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
He with the heart of an old violin,<br />
Vibrant at every least stir in the place,<br />
Lyric of woods where the thrushes begin,<br />
Wave-questing wanderer, still for a space,--<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
What will the child of his be (so I muse),<br />
Wood-flower, sea-flower, star-flower rare?<br />
Worlds here to choose from, and which will she choose,<br />
She whose first world is an armsweep of air?<br />

<p class="stanza">
Baby Karlene, you are wondering now<br />
Why you can't reach the great moon that you see<br />
Just at your hand on the edge of the bough<br />
That waves in the window-pane--how can it be?<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
All your world yet hardly lies out of reach<br />
Of ten little fingers and ten little toes.<br />
You are a seed for the sky there to teach<br />
(And the sun and the wind and the rain) as it grows.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Just a green leaf piercing up to the day,<br />
Pale fleck of June to come, just to be seen<br />
Through the rough crumble of rubble and clay<br />
Lifting its loveliness, dawn-child, Karlene!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<a id="page015"></a>
Fragile as fairycraft, dew-dream of love,--<br />
Never a clod that has marred the slim stalk,<br />
Never a stone but its frail fingers move,<br />
Bent on the blue sky and nothing can balk!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Blue sky and wind-laughters, that is thy dream.<br />
Ah the brave days when thy leafage shall toss<br />
High where gold noondays and sunsets a-stream<br />
Mix with its moving and kiss it across.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
There the great clouds shall go lazily by,<br />
Coo! thee with shadows and dazzle with shine,<br />
Drench thee with rain-guerdons, bless thee with sky,<br />
Till all the knowledge of earth shall be thine.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Wind from the ice-floe and wind from the palm,<br />
Wind from the mountains and wind from the lea--<br />
How they will sing thee of tempest and calm!<br />

<p class="stanza">
What will you be in that summer, Karlene?<br />
Apple-tree, cherry-tree, lily, or corn?<br />
Red rose or yellow rose, gray leaf or green?<br />
Which will you choose now the year's at its morn?<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Somewhere even now in thy heart is the will,--<br />
"I shall be Golden Rod, slender and tall--<br />
I shall be Pond Lily, secret and still--<br />
I shall be Sweetbriar, Queen of them all--<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
"I shall give shade for the weary to rest--<br />
I shall grow flax for the naked to wear--<br />
Figs for a feast and all comers to guest--<br />
Wreaths that girls twine in the laugh of their hair--<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<a id="page016"></a>
"Ivy for scholars and myrtle for lovers,<br />
Laurel for conquerors, poets, and kings--<br />

"I shall rise tall as an elm in my grace--<br />
I shall be clothed as catalpa is clad--<br />
Poets shall crown me with lyrics of praise--<br />
Lovers for lure of my blossoms go mad!"<br />

<p class="stanza">
Which shall it be, baby? Guess you at all?<br />
Only I know in the lull of the year<br />
You have said now where your choosing shall fall,<br />
Only you have not yet heard yourself, dear.<br />

<p class="stanza">
So, like a mocking-bird, up in the trees,<br />
I watching wondering where you have grown,<br />
Borrow a note from a birdfellow's glees,<br />
Fittest to sing you, and make it my own.<br />

<p class="stanza">
Only I know as I wonder, Karlene,<br />

Good-morning, Karlene. It's a very<br />

And, pardon me, such a real chin!<br />

And may I--Ah, thank you; the pleasure<br />

May I introduce myself as your<br />
Most dutiful godfather, dear?<br />

<p class="stanza">
I have fumed, like champagne that is fizzy,<br />
To pay my respects at your door.<br />
But the publishers keep one <i>so</i> busy.<br />

</p>
<p class="stanza">
Karlene, you're a very small lady<br />
To venture so far all alone;<br />
Especially into so shady<br />
A place as this planet has grown.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
When <i>I</i> now, my dear, was at <i>your</i> age,<br />
When nobody tried to be rich,<br />
But lived on high thinking and porridge<br />
(And didn't know t' other from which!),<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
For a girl to go out unattended<br />
Was considered "not only unwise<br />
And improper--" Our grandmothers ended<br />
By lifting to heaven their eyes.<br />

<p class="stanza">
And yet even now, though it's shocking<br />
To slander these wonderful years,<br />
I dare say an inch of black stocking<br />
Could set all the world by the ears.<br />

<p class="stanza">
Black, mind you, not blue! It's a trifle;<br />
But trifling in stockings won't do;<br />
For love has an eye like a rifle<br />
(His bandage is slipping askew).<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
But there! You are simply <i>too</i> charming.<br />
No doubt you'll be modern enough<br />
<a id="page018"></a>
(Though the speed of the world is alarming)<br />
To win with a delicate bluff,<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
As we say when we're raking the chips in,<br />
On a hand that was not over strong--<br />
But I see you are pursing your lips in;<br />
Perhaps I am prating too long.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Anyhow you'll be learned in isms,<br />
And talk pterodactyls in French,<br />
And know polyhedrons from prisms,--<br />
Though you may not know how to retrench.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
You will fall out of love with digamma<br />
To fall in again with Delsarte;<br />
You will make a new Syriac grammar,<br />
And know all the popes off by heart.<br />

<p class="stanza">
What Socrates said to Xantippe<br />

<p class="stanza">
<a id="page019"></a>
You will solve every riddle in Browning;<br />

<p class="stanza">
But you'll scorn to know why there's a tax on<br />

<p class="stanza">
All winter you'll read mathematics<br />
(Oh, you'll be a terrible "prod"),<br />
And in June, at the Senior Dramatics,<br />
You will play like a star. But it's odd,<br />

<p class="stanza">
Since you'll quote every cadence in Kipling<br />
And Arnold (of course I mean Matt),<br />
If you don't make a bard of some stripling<br />
Before he knows where he is at.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
I am sure you'll be lovely as Trilby,<br />

You will turn up your nose at poor "Thy will,"<br />
With a haughty agnostical sniff,<br />

Has a future conditional "if."<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
And then you will come to your senses,<br />
And find out why women were made;<br />
<a id="page020"></a>
And men too; and why there are fences<br />
All round the whole lot where you strayed,<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
While you wore yourself down to a shadow<br />
Yet failed to discover your sphere;<br />
For you'll see Adam down in the meadow<br />
And think what a goosey you were!<br />

<p class="stanza">
And then when your classmates are singing<br />
Once more for good-by the old glees,<br />
And the round painted lanterns are swinging<br />
And sputtering out in the trees,<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
When everything stales and withers<br />
Except the great stars up above,<br />
Your heartstrings will all go to smithers,<br />
You'll just be one crumple of love.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
And Adam will be such a duffer<br />
(Dear fellow, I mean), he'll contrive,<br />
Till you make him, to not make him suffer,<br />
The happiest mortal alive.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Oh, it makes me too ill to continue,<br />
Imagining how it will be<br />
When some dapper youth comes to win you<br />
And smiles condescension on me!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
I shall loathe his immaculate breeding,<br />
And advise you in time to refuse.<br />
To think he will share in your reading,<br />
And even unbutton your shoes!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
And yet when for that precious laddie<br />
Your hair is all crinkled and curled,<br />
I guess you'll be just like your daddy,<br />
The dearest old soul in the world!<br />

Eyes like the lakes of Killarney for clarity,<br />
Nose that turns up without any vulgarity,<br />

Some day, where gratitude seems but a platitude,<br />

Saint Kavin was a gentleman,<br />
He came from Tipperary;<br />
And woman was the only thing<br />
That ever made him scary.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
For Kavin was a tender youth,<br />
And he was very simple;<br />
He feared the wiles of maiden smiles,<br />
And fainted at a dimple.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
But when Kathleen at seventeen<br />
Came down the street one morning,<br />
The luck of man came over him<br />
And took him without warning.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Afraid to meet a foolish fate<br />
By green sea or by dry land,<br />
He fled away without delay<br />
And sought a desert island.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
But even there he felt despair;<br />
For happiness is only<br />
The hope of doing something else;<br />
And he was very lonely.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
He vowed to lead a life of prayer<br />
Because that he had lost her;<br />
And every time he thought of her<br />
He said a <i>Pater noster</i>.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Yet hard it is for man to change<br />
The less love for the greater;<br />
And every time he reached <i>Amen</i>,<br />
He must go back to <i>Pater</i>.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<a id="page029"></a>
And so he grew a year or two<br />
Disconsolate and holy,<br />
While friends he'd known long since had grown<br />
Papas and roly-poly.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Until one day, one blessed day,<br />
A-moping like a Hindoo,<br />
He saw Kathleen in mournful mien<br />
A-passing by his window.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
He threw away his rosary,<br />
His <i>Paters</i> and his <i>Aves</i>;<br />
For love is stronger than the wind<br />
That wafts a thousand navies.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
The holy man went forth to war,<br />
But not against the devil.<br />
He led the maid within for shade,<br />
And treated her most civil.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
He gave her cakes, he gave her wine,<br />
He set his best before her;<br />
And then invited her to dine--<br />
Thenceforth--with her adorer.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Her little head went round for joy;<br />
She tried to kick the rafter:<br />
So Kavin was a saint no more,<br />
And happy ever after.<br />

Once I met a soncy maid,<br />
Soncy maid, soncy maid,<br />
Once I met a soncy maid<br />
In the Wayland willows.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<a id="page030"></a>
All her hair was goldy brown,<br />
Goldy brown, goldy brown,<br />
In the sun a single braid<br />
To her waist hung down.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Honey bees, honey bees,<br />
You are roving fellows!<br />
Idly went the doxy wind<br />
In the Wayland willows.<br />

<p class="stanza">
There I caught her eye a-dance,<br />
Through the catkins downy.<br />
"Heigho, Brownie-pate," said I;<br />
"Heigho," said my Brownie.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Then I kissed my soncy maid,<br />
Soncy maid, soncy maid,<br />
Kissed and kissed my soncy maid<br />
In the Wayland willows.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Goldy eyes and goldy hair,<br />
And little gypsy bosom,<br />
Chin and lip and shoulder tip,<br />
Blossom after blossom!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Hand in hand and cheek by cheek<br />
All the morning weather!<br />
How the yellow butterflies<br />
Danced and winked together!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Till the day went down the hill<br />
Where the shadows waded.<br />
"Heigho, Soncy!" "Heigho, me!"<br />
Then I did as day did.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<a id="page031"></a>
All her tousled beauty bright<br />
And teasing as before,<br />
I left her there in sweet despair,<br />
A soncy maid no more.<br />

Madeline came down the orchard<br />
With a mischief in her eye,<br />

Four bright eyes that found life lovely,<br />

Ay, for there it is, love--that's the deepest.<br />

I would bare my soul to thy sight--<br />

I saw him go down to the water to bathe;<br />

<p class="stanza">
I dreamed of Sappho on a summer night.<br />
Her nightingales were singing in the trees<br />
Beside the castled river; and the wind<br />
Fell like a woman's fingers on my cheek.<br />
And then I slept and dreamed and marked no change;<br />
<a id="page034"></a>
The night went on with me into my dream.<br />
This only I remember, that I cried:<br />
"O Sappho! ere I leave this paradise,<br />
Sing me one song of those lost books of yours<br />
For which we poets still go sorrowing;<br />
That when I meet my fellows on the earth<br />
I may rejoice them more than many pearls;"<br />
And she, the sweetly smiling, answered me,<br />
As one who dreams, "I have forgotten them."<br />

<p class="stanza">
The blue night, like an angel, came into the room,--<br />
Came through the open window from the silent sky<br />
Down trellised stairs of moonlight into the dear room<br />
As if a whisper breathed of some divine one nigh.<br />
The nightingales, like brooks of song in Paradise,<br />
Gurgled their serene rapture to the silent sky--<br />
Like springs of laughter bubbling up in Paradise,<br />
The serene nightingales along the riverside<br />
Purled low in every tree their star-cool melodies<br />
Of joy--in every tree along the riverside.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Did the vain garments melt in music from your side?<br />
Did you rise from them as a lily flowers i' the air?<br />
--But you were there before me like the Night's own bride--<br />
I dared not call you mine. So still and tall you were,<br />
I never dreamed that you were mine--I never dreamed<br />
<a id="page035"></a>
I loved you--I forgot I loved you. You were air<br />
And music, and the shadows that you stood in, seemed<br />
Like priests that keep their sombre vigil round a shrine--<br />
Like sombre priests that watch about a glorious shrine.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
And then you stepped into the moonlight and laid bare<br />
The wonder of your body to the night, and stood<br />
With all the stars of heaven looking at you there,<br />
As simply as a saint might bare her soul to God--<br />
As simply as a saint might bathe in lakes of prayer--<br />
Stood with the holy moonlight falling on you there<br />
Until I thought that in a glory unaware<br />
I had seen a soul stand forth and bare itself to God--<br />
A saintly soul lay bare its innocence to God.<br />

<p class="stanza">
The scent of honeysuckle,<br />
Drugging the twilight<br />
With its sweet opiate of lovers' dreams!<br />
The last red glow of the setting sun<br />
On the red brick wall<br />
Of the neighboring house,<br />
And the scramble of red roses over it!<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Slowly, slowly<br />
The night smokes up from the city to the stars,<br />

With dim breast rising and falling<br />
And a smile of delicate dreams.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<a id="page036"></a>
Softly, softly<br />
The wind comes into the garden,<br />
Like a lover that fears lest he waken his love,<br />

And his locks weep with the opiate odor of honeysuckle.<br />
Sighing, sighing<br />
As a lover that yearns for the lips of his love,<br />
In a torment of bliss,<br />
In a passionate dreaming of bliss,<br />
The wind in the trees of the garden!<br />

A group of negroes passing in the street<br />

Waves of dream!<br />
Spell of the summer night!<br />

He travels by a polar star,<br />
Now bright, now hidden,<br />
For a free land, though rest be far<br />
And roads forbidden,<br />

Till on a day with sweet coarse bread<br />
And wine she stays him,<br />

So we are hers. And, fellows mine<br />
Of fin and feather,<br />

By lost indenture<br />
You flock and gather and are gone:<br />
The old adventure!<br />

My gypsy presage;<br />
And on the brink of fall I wait<br />
The darkling message.<br />

The sign, from prying eyes concealed,<br />
Is yet how flagrant!<br />
Here's ragged-robin in the field,<br />
A simple vagrant.<br />

The soul to fire.<br />

Here many a red line,<br />

Dense to the dense.<br />

No April robin,<br />

Your subtile reading<br />
Made clear to us.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<a id="page051"></a>
You made us farers<br />
And equal sharers<br />
With homespun wearers<br />
In home-made joys;<br />

No plea convinces<br />
That spirit winces<br />
At dust and noise.<br />

<p class="stanza">
When Fate was nagging,<br />

When winter's arrow<br />
Pierced to the marrow,<br />

The Bishop's Tomb.<br />

<p class="stanza">
When winds were harshish,<br />

<p class="title"><a id="SHAKESPEARE"></a>SHAKESPEARE HIMSELF: FOR THE UNVEILING
OF MR. PARTRIDGE'S STATUE OF THE POET.</p>

<p class="stanza">
The body is no prison where we lie<br />
Shut out from our true heritage of sun;<br />
It is the wings wherewith the soul may fly.<br />
Save through this flesh so scorned and spat upon,<br />
No ray of light had reached the caverned mind,<br />
No thrill of pleasure through the life had run,<br />
No love of nature or of humankind,<br />
Were it but love of self, had stirred the heart<br />
To its first deed. Such freedom as we find,<br />
We find but through its service, not apart.<br />
And as an eagle's wings upbear him higher<br />
Than Andes or Himalaya, and chart<br />
Rivers and seas beneath; so our desire,<br />
<a id="page054"></a>
With more celestial members yet, may soar<br />
Into the space of empyrean fire,<br />
Still bodied but more richly than before.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
The body is the man; what lurks behind<br />
Through it alone unveils itself. Therefore<br />
We are not wrong, who seek to keep in mind<br />
The form and feature of the mighty dead.<br />
So back of all the giving is divined<br />
The giver, back of all things done or said<br />
The man himself in elemental speech<br />
Of flesh and bone and sinew utter&egrave;d.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
This is thy language, Sculpture. Thine to reach<br />
Beneath all thoughts, all feelings, all desires,<br />
To that which thinks and lives and loves, and teach<br />
The world the primal selfhood of its sires,<br />
Its heroes and its lovers and its gods.<br />
So shall Apollo flame in marble fires,<br />
The mien of Zeus suffice before he nods,<br />
So Gautama in ivory dream out<br />
The calm of Time's untrammelled periods,<br />
So Sigurd's lips be in themselves a shout.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Mould us our Shakespeare, sculptor, in the form<br />
His comrades knew, rare Ben and all the rout<br />
That found the taproom of the Mermaid warm<br />
With wit and wine and fellowship, the face<br />
Wherein the men he chummed with found a charm<br />
To make them love him; carve for us the grace<br />
That caught Anne Hathaway in Shottery-side,<br />
The hand that clasped Southampton's in the days<br />
Ere that dark dame, of passion and of pride<br />
Burned in his heart the brand of her disdain,<br />
The eyes that wept when little Hamnet died,<br />
The lips that learned from Marlowe's and again<br />
<a id="page055"></a>
Taught riper lore to Fletcher and the rest,<br />
The presence and demeanor sovereign<br />
At last at Stratford calm and manifest,<br />
That rested on the seventh day and scanned<br />
His work and knew it good, and left the quest<br />
And like his own enchanter broke his wand.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
No viewless mind! The very shape, no less,<br />
He used to speak and smile with, move and stand!<br />
God is most God not in his loneliness,<br />
Unfellowed, discreationed, unrevealed,<br />
Nor thundering on Sinai, pitiless,<br />
Nor when the seven vials are unsealed,<br />
But when his spirit companions with our thought<br />
And in his fellowship our pain is healed;<br />
And we are likest God when we are brought<br />
Most near to all men. Bring us near to him,<br />
The gentle, human soul whose calm might wrought<br />
Imperious Lear and made our eyes grow dim<br />
For Imogen,--who, though he heard the spheres<br />
"Still choiring to the young-eyed cherubim,"<br />
Could laugh with Falstaff and his loose compeers<br />
And love the rascal with the same big heart<br />
That o'er Cordelia could not stay its tears.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
For still the man is greater than his art.<br />
And though thy men and women, Shakespeare, rise<br />
Like giants in our fancy and depart,<br />
Thyself art more than all their masteries,<br />
Thy wisdom more than Hamlet's questionings<br />
Or the cold searching of Ulysses' eyes,<br />
Thy mirth more sweet than Benedick's flouts and flings,<br />
Thy smiling dearer than Mercutio's,<br />
Thy dignity past that of all thy kings,<br />
And thy enchantment more than Prospero's.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<a id="page056"></a>
For thou couldst not have had Othello's flaw,<br />
Not erred with Brutus,--greater, then, than those<br />
For all their nobleness. Oh, albeit with awe,<br />
Leave we the mighty phantoms and draw near<br />
The man that fashioned them and gave them law!<br />
The Master Poet found with scarce a peer<br />
In all the ages his domain to share,<br />
Yet of all singers gentlest and most dear!<br />
Oh, how shall words thy proper praise declare,<br />
Divine in thy supreme humanity<br />
And near as the inevitable air?<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
So he that wrought this image deemed of thee;<br />
So I, thy lover, keep thee in my heart;<br />
So may this figure set for men to see<br />
Where the world passes eager for the mart,<br />
Be as a sudden insight of the soul<br />
That makes a darkness into order start,<br />
And lift thee up for all men, fair and whole,<br />
Till scholar, merchant farmer, artisan,<br />
Seeing, divine beneath the aureole<br />
The fellow heart and know thee for a man.<br />

They yammered and went it blind.<br />

Hem was the father of bigots and bores;<br />

But God was an artist from the first,<br />
And knew what be was about;<br />
While over his shoulder sneered these two,<br />
And advised him to rub it out.<br />

They prophesied ruin ere man was made:<br />
"Such folly must surely fail!"<br />
And when he was done, "Do you think, my Lord,<br />

And still in the honest working world,<br />
With posture and hint and smirk,<br />
These sons of the devil are standing by<br />

They balk endeavor and baffle reform,<br />
In the sacred name of law;<br />

Accomplished his despair?--one touch revealing<br />
All he had put of life, thought, vigor, feeling,<br />

Raw pigment, scarce a scrap of soul concealing!<br />
What poet has not found his spirit kneeling<br />
A sudden at the sound of such or such<br />
Strange verses staring from his manuscript,<br />
Written he knows not how, but which will sound<br />
Like trumpets down the years? So Accident<br />

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
